The identification of the double-helix structure of DNA was one of the most
important discoveries of the 20th century, for which Francis Crick, James
Watson, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize. However,
recent experiments[^1] have shown that the Watson-Crick base pairing motif
is not the only one that is significant in physiological DNA. Another
structure, proposed by Karst Hoogsteen in ???,[^2] also plays a role. We
have simulated the transition between the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base
pairing motifs, in order to better understand its mechanism and kinetics.

The exact importance of these base pairs in the Hoogsteen motif is still
unknown. However, some base pairs may spend as much as 1% of their time in
the Hoogsteen state, and that's enough that it could be biologically
important. Furthermore, stabilizing the Hoogsteen conformation might also be
a new aim for drugs, such as antivirals.

What's the difference between Hoogsteen and Watson-Crick? Recall that 
DNA consists of four base pairs (A, T, C, and G), which can be split into
two groups: purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (T and C). The pyrimidines
have a six-membered ring, whereas the purines have both a five-membered ring
*and* a six-membered ring. Every base pair is between one purine and one
pyrimidine.
