Under the direction of Prof. Clifford E. Dykstra of Indiana
University-Purdue University Indianapolis, I used the [Molecular Mechanics
for Clusters](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00198a029) scheme to develop an
approximate version of the H<sub>2</sub>-benzene ab initio potential energy
surface.  Using previously developed parameters for the
[H<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>
interaction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp037209u), I was able to show that
our model represented clusters of H<sub>2</sub> around a benzene with good
accuracy.
