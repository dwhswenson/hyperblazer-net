A fully accurate description of chemical dynamics would be completely
quantum mechanical. However, even with the best computers who have today,
simulations of full quantum dynamics are restricted to a small number of
atoms. On the other hand, simulations of classical dynamics routinely
involves hundreds of thousands of atoms, or even more. Of course, pure
classical dynamics does not include quantum effects.

The semiclassical initial value representation (SC-IVR) is an approach that
uses many classical trajectories to approximate quantum dynamics. It
has the accuracy to capture all quantum effects relevant to chemical
dynamics, while being much easier to calculate than the full quantum
dynamics. The research described below includes efforts to expand the SC-IVR
and to make it more efficient.

Projects within this research line have included:

* Reducing the number of trajectories needed by using [time-dependent
  sampling](/research/time-dependent-scivr)
* Reducing the per-trajectory cost with [a new way to calculate the
  monodromy matrix](/research/pfd-monodromy)

If you're interested in getting more of an introduction to the SC-IVR, I'd
recommend the first chapter of [my dissertation](/thesis).
