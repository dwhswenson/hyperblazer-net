The [semiclassical initial value representation (SC-IVR)](/research/scivr)
uses many classical trajectories to approximate quantum dynamics. Those
trajectories can be split into two parts: an easy part to calculate
(position and velocities) and a hard part to calculate (the monodromy
matrix). Time-dependent importance sampling reduces the total number of
expensive trajectories needed by using the easier calculation to filter out
trajectories that don't contribute to the total.
