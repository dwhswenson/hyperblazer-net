The flow of electronic excitations through matter is central to many
scientific problems, from photosynthesis and the development of new solar
technologies, to molecular scale electronics and the next generation of
computing devices. As these technologies move toward the nanoscale, the
interplay between the motion of electrons and the motion of the atomic
nuclei becomes very important.

Full quantum dynamics with atomistic resolution will not be feasible, so we
develop semiclassical approaches instead. One of the tricks we use is to
convert the electronic quantum dynamics into classical dynamics. This
approach was originally developed by Meyer and Miller, and was later shown
by Stock and Thoss to be exact under certain circumstances, and has been
very successful in describing nonadiabatic dynamics where there's only one
exciton. But with multiple excitons, the fermionic behavior can become
important.

I developed a variant of this classical mapping approach which could be
used for systems like molecular electronics, where there are many excitons
and their fermionic character is important.
