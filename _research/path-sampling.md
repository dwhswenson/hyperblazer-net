title: Path Sampling
layout: page
---

Path sampling approaches provide techniques to extend the effective
timescale accessible to molecular simulations, while still retaining the
highest levels of resolution in time and space. This allows us to study
important problems in biological chemistry, such as protein conformational
changes (often associated with cancer), drug binding and unbinding (to
design more effective medicines), protein aggregation (important for
understanding Alzheimer's), as well as problems in materials science, such
as crystallization.

My work includes both methodological development of path sampling tools and
application of those tools to problems in biological chemistry and materials
science.
