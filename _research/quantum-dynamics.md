Chemistry exists at the edge between quantum and classical dynamics.
Classical dynamics works for large things: the sorts of things you can see
with your eye, and even all the way down to larger molecules. But small
atoms, such as hydrogen, are light enough that quantum mechanics can have a
large effect on their dynamics. This can play a role in everything from ???
