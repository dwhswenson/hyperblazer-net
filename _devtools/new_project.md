# Adding a new project

(Assuming this new project is in the `research/` section.)

1. Add the the project to `collections` in `_config.yml`
2. Add an image for the project in `assets/research/project/`
3. Create the overview in `_research/project.md`. Be sure to add as much
   metadata as possible to the YAML frontmatter.
4. Add posts for results (papers, talks) from the project (do not merge
   until you have at least one of these!)
5. Add the project to _data/_navigation.yml (if desired)
6. Add the project to the main page (??? how???) (if desired)
