And just in case you're wondering whether you've found the right David
Swenson, here are some things you might know me from:

* Born 1981. Spent my first few years in Warsaw, Indiana.
* From about 1986 until 1999 I lived in Indianapolis, Indiana. Preschool at
  [Meridian Hills Preschool][meridianhills], elementary school at [Nora
  Elementary][nora], middle school at [Northview][northview], high school at
  [Brebeuf Jesuit][brebeuf], and took a few classes at [IUPUI][iupui]
  simultaneously with my senior year in high school.
* From 1999 to 2003 I was an undergraduate at [Colorado College][cc]. In that
  time I also did some research at [University of Oregon][oregon], spent a
  semester in [Avignon, France][avignon], and spent a summer doing research
  at [Université Bordeaux I][bordeaux].
* From 2003 to 2005 I was a student at [Université Louis Pasteur][ulp], in
  Strasbourg, France. I spent summers in Indianapolis (where my parents
  live) doing research. During the 2003-2004 academic year, I was an English
  Teaching Assistant at [Lycée Le Corbusier][lecorbu], in Illkirch, France.
* From 2005-2011, I was doing my PhD in theoretical chemistry at the
  [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley].
* During the fall of 2008, I did an internship at [D. E. Shaw Research,
  LLC][desres], in New York.
* From August-December 2011, I was a post-doc at [Tel Aviv
  University][telaviv].
* Since January 2012, I am a post-doc in the [Computational Chemistry
  Group][molsim] of the [van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences][hims]
  at the [Universiteit van Amsterdam][uva].
* During the fall of 2015, I was a visiting post-doc at [Memorial Sloan
  Kettering Cancer Center][mskcc], in New York.

If none of that fits the David Swenson you know, then it's probably not me.
