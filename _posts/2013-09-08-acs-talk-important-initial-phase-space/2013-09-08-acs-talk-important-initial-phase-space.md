  Slides from a talk I gave at the ACS National Meeting, introducing some of my
  work on the "important initial phase space distribution."

I gave a talk about my work on the important initial phase space
distribution in semiclassical dynamics at the ACS National Meeting in
Indianapolis, IN.  My talk was titled "Important initial phase space
distributions in semiclassical dynamics and the nature of quantum
coherences," and was part of the "Quantum Mechanics in Many Dimensions"
session organized by the Division of Physical Chemistry.
