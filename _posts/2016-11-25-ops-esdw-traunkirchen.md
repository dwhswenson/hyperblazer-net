title: Workshop on OpenPathSampling in Traunkirchen, Austria
---

I helped run an workshop in Traunkirchen, Austria, where participants
learned to use and to contribute code to OpenPathSampling. As part of that
workshop, I gave an extended overview of OPS. My slides are embedded below;
all the materials from the workshop are available in the files section of
the [workshop's page on the CECAM site][esdw1_page].
