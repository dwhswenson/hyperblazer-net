  A talk at the Dutch national chemistry conference about my work on the
  transition from the Watson-Crick to Hoogsteen base pairing motifs.

I gave an invited talk at the Dutch national chemistry conference, CHAINS
(CHemistry As INnovating Science), about the simulations I've been doing
with Jocelyne Vreede and Peter Bolhuis to study the Watson-Crick to
Hoogsteen base pair motif transition in DNA. The session was entitled "DNA
structure and integrity", and primarily included experimental biochemists,
so my presentation was aimed at an audience with less simulation experience.
