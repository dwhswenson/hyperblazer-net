My paper introducing multiple interface set transition interface sampling
(MISTIS) has been published online in the Journal of Chemical Physics. This
paper introduces the methodology (including special aspects such as the
minus move for multiple interface sets) and demonstrates its use on a simple
model that shows how seemingly independent rare events can be correlated.
