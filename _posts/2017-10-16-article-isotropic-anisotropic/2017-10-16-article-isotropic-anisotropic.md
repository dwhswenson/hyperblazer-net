title: Article on effects of isotropic and anisotropic interaction on assembly
  processes
teaser: > 
  What is the interplay between isotropic interactions and decoy anisotropic
  interactions during simple assembly processes? I explored this in a paper
  with Arthur Newton, Ramses Kools, and Peter Bolhuis.

Assembly processes, where several subunits join together, are important in many
areas of chemical physics. For example, during viral replication proteins join
together to form the capsid, the outer shell of the virus. Such self-assembly
processes are also important for colloidal "patchy particle" systems.

In this study, we wanted to see what happened when, in addition to the target
binding site, there was also a decoy site that bound, but not as well. These
were our specific (anisotropic) interactions. In addition, we studied this
system with and without an additional isotropic (non-specific) interaction. We
found trade-offs as the isotropic attraction was increased. Interestingly, this
leads to the suggestion that cooperative effects in multiparticle systems can
cause a maximum in the association rates.
