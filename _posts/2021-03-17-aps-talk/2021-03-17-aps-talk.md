  I presented a (virtual) talk about channel switching in path sampling for the
  2021 APS March Meeting.

I gave a (virtual) presentation at the American Physical Society March Meeting.
My talk was about some work I had been doing on switching between different
channels during path sampling. I wasnâ€™t able to complete as much of the new
work as I would have liked to show off, but my talk did highlight how the
theme of channel switching sort of runs through a lot of the work I had done
over the last few years.
