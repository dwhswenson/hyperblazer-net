teaser: >
    The first paper I submitted, developing a potential energy surface for
    hydrogen clustering around benzene.

My paper developing a potential energy surface to the H<sub>2</sub>-benzene
interaction, and applying it to clusters of H<sub>2</sub> around benzene,
has been published online by Chemical Physics.
