title: Talk on Scalability of Path Sampling Simulations

  How does OpenPathSampling's Gromacs engine scale? And how does path sampling
  scale in general? I gave a talk on these topics at a conference on extreme
  scale computing.

I was asked to contribute a talk at the E-CAM Extreme Scale State of the Art
Workshop, held in Barcelona in July 2017. I spoke about the in-progress Gromacs
engine for OpenPathSampling, showing that the overhead added by OPS is
negligible compared to the cost of the dynamics. I also gave some discussion on
the general problems of scalability in path sampling simulations.
