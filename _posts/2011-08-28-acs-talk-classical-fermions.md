  A talk about my DCMF method, presented at the 2011 ACS National Meeting in
  Denver.

I gave a talk about my methods for classical mappings of fermionic dynamics in
the "Emerging Technologies in Computational Chemistry" symposium at the 2011
American Chemical Society National Meeting in Denver, CO.

This is a practice run-through of the talk I gave.
