teaser: >
  We have (finally!) released OpenPathSampling 1.0!
---

I've been developing OpenPathSampling (OPS) for many years now, and we've finally released version 1.0.
OPS has been used in the research projects of several colleagues, so we're already quite confident in its stability.
The final delay in releasing 1.0 was that we needed author permissions to switch to a more permissive license.
As of 1.0, we release under the MIT license, and we're also now taking contributions from others.
