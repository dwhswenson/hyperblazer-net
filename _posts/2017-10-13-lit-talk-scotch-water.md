  Two of my favorite things in the world: Molecular dynamics and Scotch whisky.
  How did someone else write this paper before I did?

In the University of Amsterdam's Molecular Simulation group, we presented
interesting scientific papers from recent literature a couple of times per
year. When I saw a paper that combined two of my favorite topics (molecular
dynamics and Scotch whisky) to investigate the common (connoisseur) claim that
a couple drops of water can improve the whisky, I had to give it a critical
eye. This talk *might* involve a few images of my own whisky collection.
