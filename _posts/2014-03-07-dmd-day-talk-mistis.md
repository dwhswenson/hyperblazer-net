title: Talk on multiple interface set TIS at Dutch Molecular Dynamics Day
---

I gave a talk at Dutch Molecular Dynamics Day, held in Enschede,
Netherlands, about my work on multiple interface set transition interface
sampling. The talk was titled "Sampling networks of rare events with multiple interface set transition interface sampling."

TODO: add slides
