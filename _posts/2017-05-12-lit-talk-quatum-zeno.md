title: "Literature talk: Using the quantum Zeno effect for counterfactual
  communication"
tags: ['talk']
layout: page
teaser: >
  The quanum Zeno effect is one of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive
  results of quantum mechanics. In this talk, I present a paper that has used
  the quantum Zeno effect for quantum communication purposes.

While in the University of Amsterdam's Molecular Simulation group, I would
periodically present a recent paper of interest. When I saw a paper in PNAS
about using the quantum Zeno effect for quantum communication, I knew I wanted
to use that one. The quantum Zeno effect is a fascinating and very unexpected
result of the mathematics of quantum mechanics. This paper gave a fascinating
way to exploit that effect.
