  I was invited to give a talk about MISTIS at the MC/QMC conference in Leuven,
  Belgium.

I gave a talk at the Eleventh International Conference on Monte Carlo and
Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific Computing about my work on multiple
interface set transition interface sampling.

Unfortunately, the final version of the slides from this were lost. I will try
to find them and post them here later. Other talks on MISTIS will give most of
the same information, though.
