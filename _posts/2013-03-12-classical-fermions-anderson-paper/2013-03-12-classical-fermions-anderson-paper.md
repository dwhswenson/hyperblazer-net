We've published another paper on the classical mappings for fermions in the
Journal of Chemical Physics. This one compares the mapping I developed to a
quaternion-based mapping approach that Bin Li developed after mine. It
applies them both to the Anderson impurity model, which adds more
complicated electron-electron interactions than had been previously
included.
