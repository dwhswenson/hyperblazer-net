  A talk I gave at the 2013 Fall National Meeting of the ACS about developments
  in transition interface sampling.

I gave a talk about multiple interface set transition interface sampling and
its application to the problem of correlated rare events at the ACS National
Metting in Indianapolis, IN. My talk was titled "Numerical study of
correlated rare events using replica exchange multiple state interface
transition interface sampling," and was part of the "Coarse-graining and
Multiscale Modeling" session organized by the Division of Physical
Chemistry.
