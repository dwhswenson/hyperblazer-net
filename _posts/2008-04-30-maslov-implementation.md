title: Tracking the Maslov index
layout: page
---

The Maslov index helps track the sign of the contributions in a
semiclassical IVR calculation, in order to ensure that they stay continuous.
While I was a graduate student, I came up with an approach to do this, based
on the IEEE standard for floating point numbers. While this isn't
necessarily a vital improvement in performance (other aspects of the
calculation are more computationally expensive), it is a good example of
how to optimize performance.
