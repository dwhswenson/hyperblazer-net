  The generalized ensembles in OPS enable powerful tools for analysis and
  simulation. This talk at a CECAM workshop in Leiden describes some of those
  tools.

I gave a talk about OpenPathSampling at the CECAM workshop on "Reaction
Coordinates from Molecular Trajectories," held in Leiden, Netherlands. This
talk was titled "Generation and Analysis of Arbitrary Path Ensembles using
OpenPathSampling." Unlike most of my talks on OPS, this one focused not on
the basics of doing path sampling, but instead on the advanced analysis and
simulation techniques that our generalized ensemble idea enables.
