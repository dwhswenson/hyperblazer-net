  I presented my DCMF method at the Dutch Molecular Dynamics Day in March 2012,
  held in Groningen.

I gave a talk about my classical mappings for fermion dynamics at the Dutch
MD Day in Groningen, NL on March 23, 2012. The talk was called "Classical
Dynamics for Nonequilibrium Quantum Transport: The Dynamics for Classically
Mapped Fermions Method." Slides are embedded below.
