title: Talk at Dutch MD day on classical fermion mappings
---

I gave a talk about my classical mappings for fermion dynamics at the Dutch
MD Day in Groningen, NL on March 23, 2012. The talk was called "Classical
Dynamics for Nonequilibrium Quantum Transport: The Dynamics for Classically
Mapped Fermions Method." Slides are embedded below.
