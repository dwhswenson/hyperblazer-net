I gave a talk at the ACS National Meeting in Chicago about OpenPathSampling and
its role in the broader computational chemistry ecosystem. In particular, this
gave me the opportunity to talk a little about the OpenPathSampling command
line interface, which I haven't had many opportunities to discuss.
