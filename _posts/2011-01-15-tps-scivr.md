    Poster on time-dependent sampling for semiclassical IVRs, which is
    essentially a generalization of transition path sampling.

I presented a poster on our time-dependent sampling for the semiclassical
initial value representation at the Mini Stat Mech Meeting in Berkeley.
Since the Mini Stat Mech Meeting is organized by David Chandler, one of the
inventors or transtiion path sampling, I focused on how the time-dependent
sampling approach is essentially a generalization of transition path
sampling.
