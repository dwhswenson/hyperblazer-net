  A talk I was invited to give about OpenPathSampling and LAMMPS.
---

I was invited to give a presentation at a one-day event called "LAMMPS for
molecular dynamics simulations: from development to applications," held in
Lyon. I gave a talk about path sampling and the (experimental) support for
LAMMPS as a molecular dynamics engine in OpenPathSampling.

In addition to the slides, which are linked below, the Jupyter notebooks for
the live demo [are in a GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/dwhswenson/9830820dbd45aa44c362d66d8c3b7a13).
