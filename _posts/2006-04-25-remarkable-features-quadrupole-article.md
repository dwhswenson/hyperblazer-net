title: Feature article on quadrupolar interactions
teaser: >
    A feature article I wrote, discussing quadrupolar interactions and my work
    on hydrogen and benzene
---

Our Feature Article in the Journal of Physical Chemistry A, which discusses
the nature of quadrupolar interactions generally and specifically includes
some of my work on H<sub>2</sub> clustering around benzene, has been
published. The cover of this issue is an image made by my co-author Heather
Jaeger to illustrate the potential energy surface I developed.
