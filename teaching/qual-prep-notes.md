title: "Teaching: Qual Prep Notes"
layout: page

The following are scans of various notes I wrote in preparation for my
qualifying exam. To exonerate any mistakes, let me remind you that these
notes reflect my understanding as of the dates written on the top. For what
it's worth, I managed to pass my qualifying exam, so I must have understood
some of it!

* [Notes on a Symplectic Classical Integrator][cr4_integrator]. This
  document cites a paper by Manolopoulos for this integration scheme. It
  really should cite Candy and Rozmus, J. Comput. Phys. **92** 230 (1991).
* [Adams-Bashforth-Moulton Predictor-Corrector Algorithms for Molecular
  Dynamics][ABM_PC_integrator]
* [Applications of Correlation Functions][corr_fcns]
* [Perturbation Theory][perturb]
* [Transition Path Sampling][TPS]. Actually, these notes came much after my
  qualifying exam, but they're also worth putting up.
* [Units [PDF]](units.pdf) A few useful unit conversions.
