Physical chemistry includes quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and
chemical dynamics and kinetics. I have worked in all aspects of theoretical
physical chemistry, and have prepared tools to help teach undergraduate and
graduate students.

* [Stat Mech Study Notes, 27 June 2006 [PDF]][sm_notes]: Notes for fellow
  grad students.  Covers the beginning of David Chandler's Introduction to
  Modern Statistical Mechanics. (I never got around to writing up more of
  these.)
* [Solutions to various problems from Chandler's Introduction to Modern
  Statistical Mechanics.](statmech/)
* [Bonus Problems for Undergrad PChem][pchem_bonus]: I came up with a few
  bonus problems while teaching the quantum side of physical chemistry. I
  never got around to writing up the answer for the last one (but there is a
  solution!)
* [Details on Problem 7-31 [PDF]][MS-7-31]: Clarification of the source of a
  formula used in problem 7-31 of McQuarrie and Simon's PChem text. (for
  undergrad PChem)
* [Solutions to problems from a gradute-level quantum mechanics
  course.](chem221a)
