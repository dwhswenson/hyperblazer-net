title: Solutions to problems from graduate quantum mechanics
layout: page
---

These are solutions I wrote when I was a TA in a graduate-level quantum
mechanics course at Berkeley. Thanks to Dan Neumark for permission to post
them here (after all, they're the solution to the problems he assigns in his
class). I hope that the detailed explanations of the solution can be
educational to those who find them here.
