title: Solutions to Chandler's Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics
layout: page
---

While I was a post-doc at Universiteit van Amsterdam, some colleagues and I
held occasional study sessions covering David Chandler's book [Introduction
to Modern Statistical Mechanics][imsm]. As a grad student I had taken a
course using that book, taught by the [author himself][chandler]. So I made
an effort to contribute a little extra by TeX'ing up the solutions, with
explanations, to many of the problems. I've uploaded them here.
