  <p>For a one-photon process, Prof. Yang showed that the selection rules are
  &Delta;L = +/- 1 and &Delta;S = 0. In this bonus problem, we're going to
  look at the transition from a hydrogen atom in its ground electronic
  configuration (1s<sup>1</sup>) to the excited state configuration
  4p<sup>1</sup> by consecutive single-photon processes.</p>

  <p>You'll probably want to start out by listing all the possible
  configurations between 1s<sup>1</sup> and 4p<sup>1</sup> (<i>e.g.</i>
  2s<sup>1</sup>, 2p<sup>1</sup>, etc.) and finding term symbols for each of
  those states (remember that p<sup>1</sup> defines the term symbol, so
  2p<sup>1</sup> has the same term symbol as 3p<sup>1</sup>, and so forth).
  You may want to lay them out in a table: figure 8.4 (p. 307) and figure 8.5
  (p. 308) might give you some ideas.</p>

  <p>So the question for you to answer is: if you have 1 photon, how many
  paths get you from 1s<sup>1</sup> to 4p<sup>1</sup>? How many paths are
  there with 2 photons? What about 4 photons? 5? The real show-offs should
  try 3 photons.</p>
