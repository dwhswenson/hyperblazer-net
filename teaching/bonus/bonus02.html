  <p>In class, Prof. Miller introduced the "rigid rotor harmonic oscillator"
  approximation for a diatomic molecule. This approximation assumes (among
  other things) that the vibrational motion can be separated from the
  rotational motion. This means that the total energy for the system is the
  sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy.</p>

  <p>Prof. Miller also discussed that the spacing between vibrational energy
  levels is substantially larger than the spacing between low rotational
  energy levels. So for this bonus problem, we're going to explore that idea
  in more detail. We'll use N<sub>2</sub> as an example system. We were given
  h&nu; = 2360 cm<sup>-1</sup> (that's also h-bar omega, which doesn't render
  in HTML) and <i>B</i> = 2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Representing the states with the
  vibrational quantum number <i>v</i> and the rotational quantum number
  <i>J</i> by the ordered pair (<i>v</i>, <i>J</i>), we'll try to answer the
  following questions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>For a given vibrational state, how many rotational states have energy
    less than the next vibrational state? That is, find <i>J</i> such that
    the energy of the state (<i>v</i>, <i>J</i>) is greater than or equal to
    the energy of the state (<i>v</i> + 1, 0). Note that since the
    vibrational energy level spacing is even (from the harmonic oscillator
    approximation), this will be the same for any vibrational level
    <i>v</i>.</li>
    <li>After what rotational level does the rotational spacing become larger
    than the vibrational spacing?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Doing the math for these problems is a good start, but do think a little
  about what it means physically. Compare these spacings to the average
  thermal energy, about 200 cm<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature. Would you
  expect many molecules to be in excited vibrational states? What about
  excited rotational states? (You'll learn how to quantify how many molecules
  are expected to be in each state in 120B.)</p>
