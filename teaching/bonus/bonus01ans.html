  <p>The point of this exercise is to take small sections of the Morse
  potential and see how they compare to the potentials we know. For low
  values of <em>n</em> (energies less than around -0.8 in the diagram) the
  potential looks like this:</p>

  <p>As you can see, this looks a like a slightly lopsided harmonic
  oscillator potential. Since the energy level spacing depends on the shape,
  we would expect the energy levels to be spaced about evenly (as with the
  harmonic oscillator). Since the anharmonicity (fancy word meaning "not
  shaped like a harmonic oscillator") makes it look a little like a hydrogen
  atom potential, we'd expect levels to get a little more closely spaced.</p>

  <p>At higher energies, the Morse potential looks more like a hydrogen atom
  potential. For the hydrogen atom, we know that the energy levels get more
  closely packed together, so we would expect similar behavior in the
  high-energy Morse potential.</p>

<!--  <p>As a final note, we mentioned that the Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be
  solved exactly for this potential. Just to show off to any diff eq jocks
  (is that an oxymoron?) in the room, David has provided <a
  href="bonus/morse_exact.pdf">derivation of the Morse potential
  wavefunction</a> (PDF) for your perusal. The graphic below shows how the
  energy levels are actually spaced.</p>
