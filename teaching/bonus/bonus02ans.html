    <li><p>First we'll figure out the spacing for the vibrational levels:</p>
    <p>h&nu;((<i>v</i>+1)+1/2)- h&nu;(<i>v</i>+1/2) = h&nu;</p>
    <p>We're looking for <i>J</i> such that the energy of the rotational
    motion, <i>BJ</i>(<i>J</i> + 1) is greater than or equal to h&nu;. Since
    the rotational energy increases as <i>J</i> increases, we just need to
    find the value of <i>J</i> for which the energy is exact, and round up
    to the next integer. So we solve the quadratic equation:</p>
    <p><i>BJ</i>(<i>J</i> + 1) = h&nu;<br />
    <i>BJ</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>BJ</i> - h&nu; = 0<br />
    <i>J</i> = 1/2 (-1 + (1 + 4h&nu;/B)<sup>1/2</sup>)</p>
    <p>where the positive root is chosen because <i>J</i> must be positive.
    Plugging in numbers for N<sub>2</sub>, we obtain <i>J</i> = 33.9, so the
    lowest physically meaningful <i>J</i> for which this is true is <i>J</i>
    = 34.</li>
    
    <li><p>As above, the vibrational energy spacing is h&nu;. Now we need to
    find the rotational energy spacing; that is, the energy difference
    between the rotational state <i>J</i> + 1 and the rotational state
    <i>J</i>.</p>
    <p>E<sub><i>J</i>+1</sub>-E<sub><i>J</i></sub> = <i>B</i>(<i>J</i> +
    1)(<i>J</i> + 2) - <i>BJ</i>(<i>J</i> + 1) = <i>B</i>(<i>J</i> +
    1)((<i>J</i> + 2) - <i>J</i>) = 2<i>B</i>(<i>J</i> + 1)</p>
    <p>Setting this equal to h&nu; and rearranging a bit, we obtain <i>J</i>
    = (h&nu;)/(2<i>B</i>) - 1. Plugging in the numbers for N<sub>2</sub>, we
    find that <i>J</i> = 589.
  </ol>

  <p>When we compare the energy spacings to the thermal energy, we note that
  the average thermal energy at room temperature is about a tenth of the
  vibrational energy spacing, but is a hundred times the rotational energy
  constant. The thermal energy would correspond to a rotational quantum
  number of <i>J</i> = 9 or 10, substantially less than the <i>J</i> = 34 of
  part 1.</p>

  <p>As mentioned in the problem, the ratios of different states at a given
  temperature can be calculated using techniques which you will learn in Chem
  120B. For the vibrational distribution, you can see the calculation done on
  page 742 of McQuarrie and Simon, which gives 1.31&times;10<sup>-5</sup> as
  the fraction in the first excited vibrational state, with nearly everything
  else in the ground state.</p>

  <p>The rotational states have a more interesting distribution. The details
  of the calculation can be found on pages 744-748 of McQuarrie and
  Simon (but be careful, because Prof. Miller defines <i>B</i> in a different
  way than McQuarrie and Simon). The following graph plots the fraction of
  molecules in the first few energy levels. As you can see, the peak is
  around <i>J</i> = 6 or 7. A rotational quantum number of <i>J</i> = 34
  would be extremely unusual at room temperature. In fact, it would
  contribute a little less to the total population than the first excited
  vibrational state does, since what actually determines the contribution is
  the energy (and the energy for <i>J</i>=34 is a little higher than the
  energy for <i>v</i>=1).</p>
