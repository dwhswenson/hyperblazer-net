  In class, Prof. Miller showed that the energy levels for different
  potentials are spaced differently, and that the spacing is related to the
  shape of the potential. Specifically, he showed that the particle in a box
  energy levels become more widely spaced as the the energy level <i>n</i>
  gets higher, that the harmonic oscillator energy levels are always evenly
  spaced, and that the hydrogen atom energy levels become more closely spaced
  as <i>n</i> increases.  </p>

  <p>The Morse potential is given by the equation:</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img

  /></p>
  
  <p>It provides a relatively good approximation to a chemical bond.  The
  graph of <i>V(x)</i> is shown below (for <i>D</i> = <i>&alpha;</i> =
  1):</p>

  How would you expect the energy levels to be spaced for small <i>n</i>?
  What about for large <i>n</i>? Don't bother solving the Schr&ouml;dinger
  equation (even though it can be solved exactly for this potential); just
  use your intuition. [Hint: For small <i>n</i>, consider energies less than
  around -0.8.  For large <i>n</i>, consider energies larger than -0.5.]
