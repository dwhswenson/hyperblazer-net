This page has a number of resources I have developed to help people learn
about science. For now, they're roughly separated into subject areas.

I plan to release most of these under a Creative Commons license. Until
then, please consider all rights reserved unless otherwise stated.

### Physical Chemistry

* [Solutions to problems from Chandler's Introduction to Modern
  Statistical Mechanics](statmech/)
* [Bonus Problems for Undergrad PChem][pchem_bonus]: I came up with a few
  bonus problems while teaching the quantum side of physical chemistry. I
  never got around to writing up the answer for the last one (but there is a
  solution!)
* [Solutions to problems from a gradute-level quantum mechanics
  course](chem221a)
* [Stat Mech Study Notes, 27 June 2006][sm_notes]{: pdflink}: Notes for
  fellow grad students.  Covers the beginning of David Chandler's
  Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics. (I never got around to
  writing up more of these.)
* [Details on Problem 7-31][MS-7-31]{: pdflink}: Clarification of the source
  of a formula used in problem 7-31 of McQuarrie and Simon's PChem text.
  (for undergrad PChem)

### Qual Prep Notes

The following are scans of various notes I wrote in preparation for my
qualifying exam. To exonerate any mistakes, let me remind you that these
notes reflect my understanding as of the dates written on the top. For what
it's worth, I managed to pass my qualifying exam, so I must have understood
some of it!

* [Perturbation Theory][perturb]{: pdflink}
* [Applications of Correlation Functions][corr_fcns]{: pdflink}
* [Transition Path Sampling][TPS]{: pdflink}. Actually, these notes came
  much after my qualifying exam, but they're also worth putting up.
* [Notes on a Symplectic Classical Integrator][cr4_integrator]{: pdflink}.
  This document cites a paper by Manolopoulos for this integration scheme.
  It really should cite Candy and Rozmus, J. Comput. Phys. **92** 230
  (1991).
* [Adams-Bashforth-Moulton Predictor-Corrector Algorithms for Molecular
  Dynamics][ABM_PC_integrator]{: pdflink}
* [Units](units.pdf){: pdflink}. A few useful unit conversions.
