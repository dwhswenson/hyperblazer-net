title: Talk about OpenPathSampling at CECAM reaction coordinates workshop
---

I gave a talk about OpenPathSampling at the CECAM workshop on "Reaction
Coordinates from Molecular Trajectories," held in Leiden, Netherlands. This
talk was titled "Generation and Analysis of Arbitrary Path Ensembles using
OpenPathSampling." Unlike most of my talks on OPS, this one focused not on
the basics of doing path sampling, but instead on the advanced analysis and
simulation techniques that our generalized ensemble idea enables.
