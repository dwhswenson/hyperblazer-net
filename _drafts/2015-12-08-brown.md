title: Invited talk at Brown
---

I was invited to give a talk about my research to the Brown University
chemistry department. This talk includes my work on classical mapping for
the dynamics of fermions, some preliminary work on my Bingo sampling
approach for the semiclassical initial value representation, and a brief
aside on my path sampling work (particularly multiple interface set
transition interface sampling).
