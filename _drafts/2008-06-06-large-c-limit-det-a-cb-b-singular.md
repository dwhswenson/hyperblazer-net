In a group meeting, my Ph.D. advisor posed a mathematical question related
to something he was working on. That afternoon, I figured out and wrote up a
solution. Bill (my advisor) later confirmed the solution through a different
approach (perturbation theory). I don't think the specific approach he was
working on ever led to anything useful, but this is a nice mathematical
result.
