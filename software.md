As a theoretical and computational chemist, a lot of my daily work involves
writing software. In order to save other time so they don't have to repeat
what I've already done, I make most of the software freely available.

Most of my major software is highlighted in this section of the website.
Much more can be seen by looking at my repositories on [my GitHub
page](http://github.com/dwhswenson).
