  As I found that I was maintaining more and more repositories, one of the
  challenges I encountered was that scheduled GitHub Actions workflows stop
  running if the repository hasn't had any activity in 60 days. So I wrote
  `eshgham` (the Executive Summarizer of Health for GitHub Actions Monitoring
  -- a word that happens to also mean "my love" in Farsi) to help me keep track
  of whether my scheduled workflows are still running.
