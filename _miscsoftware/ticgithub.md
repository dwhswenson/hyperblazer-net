  Our team at Open Free Energy needed a way to track support tickets. Most
  solutions were designed for full-time support teams (and priced that way). I
  wrote `ticgithub` as a tool to link our support email to GitHub issues, where
  we could leverage the tools for notifications, assignment, and collaboration
  that are built into GitHub, and which we already used.
