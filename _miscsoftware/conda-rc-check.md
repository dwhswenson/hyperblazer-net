  When a project depends heavily on a specific dependency, it is important to
  test against pre-releases of that dependency. To help OpenPathSampling test
  against pre-releases of OpenMM, I wrote a GitHub Action to facilitate
  automatic testing if and only if a release candidate has been publiched
  recently.
