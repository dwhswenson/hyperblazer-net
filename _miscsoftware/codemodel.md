  I developed an interest in writing programs that would generate software code
  (metaprogramming), particularly as a way to make it easier to create scripts
  for OpenPathSampling. While code snippets are one approach, I thought I could
  create more flexibility by reshaping the abstract syntax tree. The result of
  those experiments was the `codemodel` package.
