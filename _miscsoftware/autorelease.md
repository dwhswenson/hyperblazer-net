  In order to simplify my release process and to avoid packaging errors,
  I developed Autorelease. Autorelease consists of several CI workflows that
  make it so that cutting a tested release is as simple as making a pull
  request pointed at a specific branch. It also contains several tools to
  ensure that version numbers are updated correctly, and to draft release notes.
