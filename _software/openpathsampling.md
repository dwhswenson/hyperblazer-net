Path sampling methods, such as [transition path sampling (TPS)][TPS] and
[transition interface sampling (TIS)][TIS] make it possible to extend the
timescale that would otherwise be accessible to simulations. However, there
was no easy-to-use software for the most efficient versions of these
methods, and so my colleagues and I developed
[OpenPathSampling](http://openpathsampling.org) (OPS), an
open-source Python framework for path sampling simulations. OPS is designed
to be both easy for novices to use, and straightforward for methods
developers to contribute to.
